//finally done, if ill will continue to handle all issues and errors i wont finish till next year.
// this is a complicated project with massive amount of error handling and comlicated functions, libraries etc.
// i have included booleans, auto, vectors, strings and other various of datatypes.
// due to it, Reema, if you reqier a report for this with all references and my explanation of how each function works and how data converts and all manipulations with it, please email me and i will make that report.
// overall i am proud of my work, i know it still as some issues but it does meet all expectations of milestone 
// most of samples and drafts can be found across this repository of mine.
